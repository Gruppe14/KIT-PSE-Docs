\section{Introduction}
This is the functional specification for Group 14 in the PSE-Project 10 in winter semester 2012/13. 
In this project we have to analyze and visualize the serverlog of http://skyserver.sdss.org, which is a big database for astronomical 
data. For this task we are going to write two separate programs. The first program is called Server Log Parser (SLP)
and is going to convert the CSV-formatted serverlog into a data-warehouse. The second program works on this data-warehouse
and allows an user to create various charts. Due to the fact that we are going to write two separate programs, many parts
of this specification are splitted in two parts. 
\newline
\newline
We have to state that no one of us has much experience in working with databases and javascript. Therefore we can't guarantee 
for the correctness of all information stated in this specification. It could happen that we will alter some of the specifications
when designing or implementing the actual program.
