\section{Introduction}
This is the functional specification for Group 14 in the PSE assignment 10 in winter semester 2012/13. 
In this project we have to analyze and visualize the serverlog of the 
\href{http://skyserver.sdss.org/public/en/}{Skyserver}, 
which is a database for astronomical data. This assignment is one of two PSE assignments which will be handled in English.
Because none of us speaks English as his first language, we have to apologize that our documentation may contain simple 
or maybe in some parts incorrectly used language. We focus more on having easy-to-understand and correct documentation 
than on perfect English, which sounds like written by a native speaker.
\newline\newline
We are going to write a web-frontend in javascript which allows users to access the finished application from everywhere
with recent browsers. The actual application can be spliited into two different parts. The first part get the internal name
Server Log Parser (SLP) and is going to convert the CSV-formatted serverlog from Skyserver into a data-warehouse. It will
be accessible via admin-login to the webpage where we can enter a logfile which will be parsed into our warehouse.
The second part - which got the internal name Warehouse Analyzing Tool (WHAT) works on this data-warehouse 
and allows every user of our webpage to create various charts, for example scatterplots and histograms.
Due to the fact that we split our project in two smaller parts, many parts of this specification 
are going to be splitted in two.
\newline
\newline
We have to state that no one of us has much experience in working with databases and javascript.
Therefore we can't guarantee for the correctness of all information stated in this specification.
It could happen that we will alter some of the specifications when designing or 
implementing the actual program.
