\section{Introduction}
This is the functional specification for Group 14 in the PSE assignment 10 in winter semester 2012/13. 
In this project we have to analyze and visualize the serverlog of the 
\href{http://skyserver.sdss.org/public/en/}{Skyserver}, 
which is a database for astronomical data. For this assignment we are going to write 
two separate applications. The first application is called Server Log Parser (SLP)
and is going to convert the CSV-formatted serverlog from Skyserver into a data-warehouse.
The second application works on this data-warehouse and allows it's users to create various charts,
for example scatterplots and histograms. Due to the fact that we split the assignment
into two separate applications, many parts of this specification are going to be 
splitted in two parts, one for each of those. 
\newline
\newline
We have to state that no one of us has much experience in working with databases and javascript.
Therefore we can't guarantee for the correctness of all information stated in this specification.
It could happen that we will alter some of the specifications when designing or 
implementing the actual program.
