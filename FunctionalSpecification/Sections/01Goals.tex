\subsection{Criteria} % Musskriterien
\subsubsection(Server Log Parser (SLP))
\begin{itemize}
\item The SLP can read a CSV-formatted log file from sdss.skyserver.org and fill a data-warehouse with multi-dimensional user information.
The dimensions of this data are location of the user, location of the database and time of the server-access. 
\item SLP will recognise invalid logs and won't add them to the data-warehouse. Every log with a mistake won't be accepted, because
an error-message is not as bad as a corrupted data-warehouse. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection(Warehouse Analyzing Tool (WHAT))
\begin{itemize}
\item WHAT can use the data-warehouse which is filled with user data from sdss.skyverser.org to create various charts. 
Those charts are created by user command and are visible on a javascript-webpage.
\item WHAT can create scatterplots and histograms from data in the warehouse.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optional criteria}

\subsection{Exclusion criteria}
\subsubsection(Server Log Parser (SLP))
\begin{itemize}
\item The SLP can only use CSV-formatted logs from sdss.skyserver.org. It can neither read logs in another format nor logs
from another source.
\item There is no way to avoid using SLP when adding data to the warehouse. This can stop corrupting the warehouse to guarantee 
correct data in the warehouse.
\item SLP doesn't correct mistakes in the log file.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection(Warehouse Analyzing Tool (WHAT))
\begin{itemize}
\item WHAT takes correct data in the warehouse for granted. It doesn't check the data because it already checked by
SLP. 
\end{itemize}
