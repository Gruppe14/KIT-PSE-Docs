\section{Data}
The product data are divided in two groups, static data, 
which are delivered with the program and Data-Warehouse data, 
which come from the Skyserver server logs, are parsed 
and loaded into the Data-Warehouse by the SLP. They can be replaced 
by clearing the Data-Warehouse and loading new data into it with the SLP.
