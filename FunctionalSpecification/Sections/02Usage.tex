\subsection{Applications}
Wat.

\subsection{Target groups}

The target group of this application is people that want to analyze and visualize data collected from the skyserver.
 This implies
 1) People that know about the skyserver.
Since the skyserver only allows queries via sql and has an arcane website this greatly reduces the prospective audience. We do not expect the webserver to run into scaling issues.
 2) People that are interested in what other people are using the web server for. 
Our project mainly visualizes sql queries from other people. Knowing sql, while not a prerequisite, would allow the user to fully utilize the software.

This is a technical audience.

That said, this does not prevent the (web) user interface from being functional, usable and prettier than what you would expect a group of computer science students to design.
 

\subsection{Operating conditions}

The program is mainly used as a website, with the primary difference being that the server has to be started if the capacity for it to run all the time on a dedicated machine doesn't exist. //this is formal english for: we do not have a server. Gibe server plos
The program needs a server to run. 

If a dedicated server exists, the program can be used from anywhere with a decent network connection with the server.

If not, the program can still be run on the same computer as the server (on localhost), but the server will have to be started first.
