\section{Operating environment}


\subsection{Software}
The client requires the latest version of a modern browser, like Chrom or Firefox. 
Other browsers might work, but might not been tested as extensively.
Javascript needs to be enabled.

The server requires a recent version of the Java Runtime Enviroment.


\subsection{Hardware}

The server has to be fast enough to support all clients. This depends on
the expected number of clients. Most computations will be done on the server.

The client needs to be fast enough to visualize the data received from the server. 
The required hardware thus depends greatly on the amount of data that needs to be 
visualized. That said, any recent computer, with for example, 
an Intel® Core™2 Duo CPU E8400 @ 3.00GHz × 2 processor, 
4GB(2x2GB) of 667Mhz DDR2 SDRAM, running Ubuntu Linux 12.10 Quantal Quetzal, 
% this was, like, a joke, because it's, like, my computer
as a point of reference, should be able to visualize about 50.000 
data points on a scatterplot with ease.


\subsection{Orgware}

The server needs to be able to connect to the client with a reasonable latency.
Also it has to be set up before the client will be able to connect to it.
