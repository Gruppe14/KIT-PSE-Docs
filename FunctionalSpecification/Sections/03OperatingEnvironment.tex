Whereas the programm and the data warehouse run on a sever,
the access to it will be via a web browser on the users computer. 
This implies that the webpage will need to be hosted on a webserver.



\subsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The server hosting the data warehouse needs  MySQL %glossary
  
  \item The server hosting the web page needs a 
  recent version of th Java Runtime Environment / Java VM  % Glossary
\end{itemize}


This software is required on the users computer:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Latest version of a modern browser
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Chrome and Firefox will be supported
  \end{itemize}
  \item JavaScript (enabled)
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Hardware}

The server has to be fast enough to support all clients. This depends on
the expected number of clients. Most computations will be done on the server.

% Is the program really local hosted? 
The client needs to be fast enough to visualize the data received from the server, as that's almost all it does.
The required hardware thus depends greatly on the amount of data that needs to be 
visualized. That said, any recent computer, with for example, 
an Intel® Core™2 Duo CPU E8400 @ 3.00GHz × 2 processor, 
4GB(2x2GB) of 667Mhz DDR2 SDRAM, running Ubuntu Linux 12.10 Quantal Quetzal, 
% this was, like, a joke, because it's, like, my computer
as a point of reference, should be able to visualize about 50.000 
data points on a scatterplot with ease.


\subsection{Orgware}

The server needs to be able to connect to the client with a reasonable latency.
Also it has to be set up before the client will be able to connect to it.

% Other direction: Program hast to be able to run query against data warehouse?

To fulfill optional requirements, the program musst be able to run queries against
the origin database. 

\subsection{Product interfaces}

To fulfill optional requirements .csv files have to be imported.
