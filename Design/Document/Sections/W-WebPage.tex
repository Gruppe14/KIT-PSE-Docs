This is a prototype webpage, to show how the GUI could look like. It is not yet complete.
There will be an admin login to access a password protected page where you can alter
some settings of the GUI, but its main purpose is to allow the admin to initialize the data warehouse
with skyserver logfiles %or just plain logfiles? not skyserver specific?
