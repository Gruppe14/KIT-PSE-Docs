\section{Libraries}

The program uses a number of external libraries to achieve its functionality. This section describes which they are,
how they interact with the program, as well as licensing information. 

-Java Play
Java play is primarily a web framework, but it includes a webserver too [].
We use it to create a modern, dynamic and interactive website, instead of a conventional java Swing GUI.

Our web server tier is just a modification of appropriate java play classes[play].

-d3.js
D3.js [d3link] is a javascript visualization library for the browser.
It allows the creation of beautiful, interactive visualizations.
It runs, as one would imagine, in our browser tier.

-Geoip
We use the Maxmind geoip Lite[geo] library to map user IPs to locations.
This allows queries based on location, as well as preserving anonymity.

-Oracle database and warehouse
We host our data in an oracle warehouse.

-oracle jdbc
Oracle jdbc is the oracle database access driver. We use it in the data access tier.



Licensing information
Most of the libraries used are open source, as well as free of charge.
The rest are from oracle. We can use them in our product, because our university has bought licenses but I don't know what happens when we release it.
(but we can use them from the university! it's ok! not evil!)

Java play is released under the Apache 2 License [apache2]
d3.js is released under the BSD License, BSD 3 Clause [bsd3]
The geoip library we use is licensed under the LGPL. [lgpl]

Oracle stuff is released under the oracle license[oracle]
