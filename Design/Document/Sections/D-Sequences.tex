\section{Sequences}
In this sections the important processes of the system are shown exemplarily. They include a request 
from the web page handled in the web server tier, a call on the facade of the application tier,
a parsing process and a chart request.

\subsection{HTTP request}
A HTTP request is triggered by the user on the web page. This sequence diagram demonstrates
the call of the index site.

\subsection{Facade call}
In the following sequence diagram a call on the application tier facade is shown 
on the example of a chart request with \texttt{computeChart(..)}.

This sequence diagram describes the process after a ParsingTask for one line was created and
called with \texttt{run()}.
