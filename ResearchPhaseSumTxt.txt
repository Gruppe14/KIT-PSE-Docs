Sql parser
	??? [x], we will probably write one.
	As we have to write a parser and analyzer for the WHERE-parts,

>> the task

1) Queries from SkyServer Database ---convert---> tabular format in database/warehouse
	- therefor develop method for analyzing the WHERE parts
	- find library assisting the parsing process (rejected)
	- ...

2) Database/warehouse ---multidimensional analysis--> visualization
	- find library helping with the diagrams [x]
	- decide which schemata and measures are allowed
	- build GUI
	- develop analysis methods
	- ...

(please extend and/or specify)


>> to be done within the research phase

search for libraries [x ]
decide when to decide which schemata will be supported/used []
set up a project in GitHub for better task managing than with this document? [x]
Replace this document by github "issues" (custom labels are allowed, this includes bugs as well as new features.)
making a short pr√§sentation with latex [x]


feel free to edit, correct and edit[x][x][x][][]
