	useful links: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8526820/free-java-data-visualization-library
	http://java-source.net/open-source/charting-and-reporting
	Can you find something better than http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/samples.html ?
	
	edit again: processing is reaaally cool, if someone has interest we can write our own library with it.
	Trying to decide if that someone is me.
		

Sql parser
	??? [x], we will probably write one.

	- find library assisting the parsing process (TBD)
	- ...

2) Database/warehouse ---multidimensional analysis--> visualization
	- find library helping with the diagrams (TBD)
	- decide which schemata and measures are allowed
	- build GUI
	- develop analysis methods
	- ...

(please extend and/or specify)


>> to be done within the research phase

search for libraries []
get familiar with Maven []
decide when to decide which schemata will be supported/used []
set up a project in GitHub for better task managing than with this document? [x]
Replace this document by github "issues" (custom labels are allowed, this includes bugs as well as new features.)
