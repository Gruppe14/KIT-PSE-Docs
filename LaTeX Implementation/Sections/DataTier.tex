\section{Changes in Data and Data access tier}


The data and the data access tier provided a lot of trouble for us.

When the decision was made to go with Oracle on thing was overlooked. The
drivers aren't free to get without a license. So we had to change from
Oracle to something other. The first idea to use Mondrian failed, as we
weren't able to set it up.

So the get anything going we decided just to run a MySQL data base and 
run a warehouse on it. Facing problems to connect to a local MySQL server,
creating the table to fullfill our needs, writting the right queries to
load data in the warehouse everything got slowed down.

Still facing problems to write the complex queries for chart requests with filters
the first version will just be able to get 1 dimensional charts without filters
just grouped by a requested thing. 
 

\subsection{Data access classes}
There is a \textit{DataMediator} of course which delegates the work and requests.

\subsubsection{MySQLAdapter}
The class \textit{MySQLAdapter} provides methods for any needed query against
the warehouse, whether extracting or loading.

When extracting it uses the help of \textit{DataChanger} to interpret the
results received from the warehouse.

\subsubsection{WHConnectionManager}
This class provides methods to get a connection from a connection pool to
the warehouse (mySQL data base).
