\section{Charts}
The charts saw a fair amount of bug fixes and improvements as well.

\subsection{Bubblechart}
A one dimensional bubblechart, where the items are sorted according to one dimension was implemented.
%TODO: War es schon immer da? :-)

\subsection{Bug fixes}
  \subsubsection{Type of data}
  The skyserver contained a significant amount of categorical data. However, their representation on the axes
  used to cause problems. The charts are now more robust and work with both numerical and categorical data.
  \subsubsection{Error}
  Errors are now thrown to differentiate between the chart with no data, and the chart with an error,
  or incorrect data (which the user will hopefully never experience).
  \subsubsection{Boring bugs}
  Boring bugs, such as the text on the data being off by a few pixels were fixed too.

\subsection{Aesthetics}
  The charts were made prettier.
  -Tooltips, or text that appears once the mouse hovers over a data point was added to every chart.
  -The css was changed.
  -The text now gets rotated on a number of cases to fit more datapoints. It also makes the charts prettier.
  
\subsection{Testing}
  We tested by hand. Something that made testing in this section easier is that it is possible to know
  how a chart is suppose to look when correct, as well as the charts consisting of different more or less discrete
  parts - for example, it is easy to tell when just an axis is broken.
  Also, it is nice to return to a chart to see how nice someone made the css this time.
