\section{Charts}
The charts saw a fair amount of bug fixes as well.

\subsection{Bubblechart}
A one dimensional bubblechart, where the items are sorted according to one dimension was implemented.
%TODO: War es schon immer da? :-)

\subsection{Bug fixes}
  \subsubsection{Type of data}
  The skyserver contained a significant amount of categorical data. However, their representation on the axes
  used to cause problems. The charts are now more robust and work with both numerical and categorical data.
  \subsubsection{Errorpicture}
  An errorpicture is thrown to differentiate between the chart with no data, and the chart with an error,
  or incorrect data (which the user will hopefully never experience)
  \subsubsection{Boring bugs}
  Boring bugs, such as the text on the data was off by a few pixels were fixed too.
  


\subsection{Rotation of text}
  Text was rotated where needed, now more datapoints fit and it looks better.

\subsection{Tooltips}
  Tooltips, or text that appears once the mouse hovers over a data point was added to every chart.
