\section{Design mistakes}

\subsection{Check for missing/empty parts}
The parser now checks if a part of the line which is parsed is missing or empty. If it is, the line is deleted and 
linesDeleted gets incremented.

\subsection{Only accept when enough lines submitted}
Added "final static double CORRECT", a double between 0 and 100, which indicates how many percent of the lines need to be
submitted correctly for the ParserMediator to return true to the facade.
