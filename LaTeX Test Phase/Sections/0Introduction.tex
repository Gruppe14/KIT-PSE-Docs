\section{Introduction}

This document is about the testing phase of the program WHAT WareHouse Analyzing Tool.
It contains descriptions of what was tested and how, which results tests produced and 
what bugs or problems were found with them.
There are also some comments about the programming and code style in general. 

The tests are grouped by tasks of the program, which mostly were also separate packages. 
The sections of this document follow this structure and complete it with the general sections concerning the whole program.

The functions which have to show the correct web pages or produce correct SQL query where tested by hand. 
This means that for a configuration and data we tested, 
if correct looking MySQL queries where produced and correct web pages or charts where shown. 
But more about this in the specific sections.

%TODO: Travis and such stuff @niko

The last section (\ref{spec}) is about complying with the requirements made in the functional specifications.
