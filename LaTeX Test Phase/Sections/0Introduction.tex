\section{Introduction}

This document is about the testing and quality assurance phase of the program WHAT WareHouse Analyzing Tool.
It contains descriptions of the components of the program tested, the individual tests,
the produced results as well as the bugs and problems uncovered in the process. 
There are also some comments about the programming and code style in general. 

The tests are grouped by tasks of the program, which also mostly were in separate packages. 
The sections of this document follow this structure and complete it with the 
general sections concerning the whole program. %wat

The functions which have to show the correct web pages or produce correct SQL query were tested by hand. 
This means that for a configuration and data, we tested 
whether correct looking MySQL queries where produced and correct web pages or charts where shown. 
But more about that in the specific sections.

We will also describe how we made use of the testing capabilities of the build managers, 
and the travis continuous integration service.

Additionally, we mention the steps we took to secure the program.


The last section (\ref{spec}) is about the compliance with the requirements set during the functional specification
phase.
