\section{Tooling and workflow}

We used JUnit for testing. Our tests are located in the test folder, and get executed with
the 'play test' command  (which is just ends up executing 'sbt test').

\subsection{Travis}
The continuous integration service travis was set up and heavily utilised. 
Each time a new commit was made to the repository on github, a computer from travis 
tried to successfully compile our program. This includes downloading the repository from github,
downloading the dependencies (such as java play),
creating the database and users needed for the warehouse, as well as building the program.

It then executed 'play test' as part of its building process, thus run our tests and notified us if they passed. As a bonus, travis builds on a linux computer, and since many of us used windows during the development process this helped with cross-platform testing.
